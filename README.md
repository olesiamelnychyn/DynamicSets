# About

This project is a result of the course Data Structures and Algorithms. The aim is to get familiar with dynamic data structures, such as trees and hashes.

# Dynamic Data Structures 

Diffrent files, except for main.c, contain a code for diffrent data structures. The main principle is the same - every structure has functions which insert and print out the structure.

During the project I got familiar with the following ones:
1. Binary search tree (`BST.c`)
2. Red-Black Tree (`RedBlackTree.c`)
3. AVL Tree (`AVL.c`)
4. Hash with simple algorithm - find next free place (`MyHash.c`)
5. Adjusted hash from source with linked lists of items of the same key (`CopiedHash.c`)

# Technical Aspects

The main code which calls data structures is placed in main.c
To run the appliction just add appropriate headers and run main.c in IDE of your choice.
