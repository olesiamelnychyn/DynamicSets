# About

This project is a result of the course Data Structures and Algorithms (WS 2019/2020). The aim is to get familiar with dynamic data structures, such as trees and hashes.

# Dynamic Data Structures 

Diffrent files, except for main.c, contain a code for diffrent data structures. The main principle is the same - every structure has functions which insert and print out the structure.

During the project I got familiar with the following ones:
1. Binary search tree ([BST.c](./BST.c))
2. Red-Black Tree ([RedBlackTree.c](./RedBlackTree.c))
3. AVL Tree ([AVL.c](./AVL.c))
4. Hash with simple algorithm - find next free place ([MyHash.c](./MyHash.c))
5. Adjusted hash from source with linked lists of items of the same key ([CopiedHash.c](./CopiedHash.c))

# Technical Aspects

The main code which calls data structures is placed in [main.c](./main.c).
To run the appliction just add appropriate headers and run [main.c](./main.c) in IDE of your choice.
